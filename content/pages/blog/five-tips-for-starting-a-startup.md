Starting a security project like TraceConsole taught us five key lessons:

**1. Automate Everything You Can** Manual log review is slow and error-prone. TraceConsole automates Windows event log analysis and threat intelligence lookups, saving hours for security teams.

**2. Integrate with Real APIs Early** We built TraceConsole to work with URLhaus, AbuseIPDB, VirusTotal, and more. Early API integration exposed edge cases and rate limits we wouldn’t have found with mock data.

**3. Build for Forensics, Not Just Alerts** Security isn’t just about blocking threats—it’s about understanding them. TraceConsole collects forensic artifacts from Amcache and Prefetch so you can investigate incidents in depth.

**4. Make Automation Safe** Automated firewall blocking is powerful, but risky. We added audit logs, change history, and admin checks to keep automation under control.

**5. Listen to Your Users** Our best features came from feedback: batch scanning, SQLite caching, and interactive CLI menus. Security teams know what they need—just ask!

TraceConsole is open source and always evolving. If you’re building a security tool, start with automation, real data, and a focus on investigation.
