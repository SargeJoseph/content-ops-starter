Our development team starts each morning reviewing the latest threat intelligence feeds and Windows event logs. We prioritize new features for TraceConsole based on user feedback and recent security incidents.

After a quick standup, engineers dive into automating log analysis, improving API integrations, and refining the CLI experience. Collaboration is key—developers, security analysts, and testers work together to ensure every release is stable and useful.

Afternoons are spent testing new automation scripts, optimizing SQLite caching, and writing documentation for upcoming features. We often run simulated incident response drills to validate TraceConsole’s detection and blocking capabilities.

By the end of the day, our team has pushed new code, reviewed pull requests, and updated the roadmap. Building TraceConsole is a continuous effort to help security teams respond faster and investigate deeper.
