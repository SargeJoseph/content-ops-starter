Tracking the right metrics is essential for security teams using TraceConsole. Here’s what we measure:

**1. Threat Intelligence Coverage** How many IPs and hashes are checked against URLhaus, AbuseIPDB, VirusTotal, and other sources? Coverage means better detection.

**2. Event Log Volume** Monitor how many Windows events are parsed daily. High volume may indicate suspicious activity or misconfigured logging.

**3. Firewall Rule Changes** Track every automated block, manual update, and rule change. Audit logs are critical for compliance and investigation.

**4. API Usage and Rate Limits** Keep an eye on API calls and cache hit rates. TraceConsole’s 90-day cache helps avoid service interruptions.

**5. Forensic Artifact Collection** Count Amcache and Prefetch extractions. More artifacts mean deeper investigations.

By focusing on these metrics, security teams can improve detection, automate response, and maintain a strong security posture with TraceConsole.
